# Debugging Guide - ESP32-S3 Issues

## 🔍 Current Status Analysis

**System Info Results:**

```
ESP32-S3 Camera System
Free Heap: 228468 bytes ✅ Good
Total Heap: 340612 bytes ✅ Good
CPU Frequency: 240 MHz ✅ Good
SD Card: Available (MMC mode) ✅ Good
SD Card Size: 3840 MB ✅ Good
WiFi Status: Disconnected ❌ Fixed (now shows AP status)
Live Stream: Working ✅ Good
```

**Issues Identified:**

- ❌ File list not showing (despite SD card detected)
- ❌ Capture image not working
- ❌ Create folder not working
- ❌ WiFi status showing wrong info (fixed)

## 🔧 Debugging Steps Applied

### 1. **Fixed WiFi Status Display**

```cpp
// Before: Wrong for Access Point mode
info += "WiFi Status: " + String(WiFi.status() == WL_CONNECTED ? "Connected" : "Disconnected");
info += "IP Address: " + WiFi.localIP().toString();

// After: Correct for Access Point mode
info += "WiFi Status: " + String(WiFi.getMode() == WIFI_AP ? "Access Point Active" : "Disconnected");
info += "AP IP Address: " + WiFi.softAPIP().toString();
info += "Connected Clients: " + String(WiFi.softAPgetStationNum());
```

### 2. **Enhanced File List Debugging**

Added detailed logging:

```cpp
Serial.printf("📂 Listing files in: %s\n", path.c_str());
Serial.printf("🔍 SD Card status - Initialized: %s, Using SPI: %s\n",
              sdCardInitialized ? "YES" : "NO",
              usingSPIMode ? "YES" : "NO");
```

### 3. **Enhanced Capture Debugging**

Added SD card check before saving:

```cpp
Serial.printf("📁 Saving to: %s (SD Mode: %s)\n", filepath.c_str(), usingSPIMode ? "SPI" : "MMC");
```

### 4. **Enhanced Create Folder Debugging**

Added parameter validation and logging:

```cpp
Serial.printf("📁 Create folder request - Base: '%s', Name: '%s'\n", basePath.c_str(), folderName.c_str());
```

## 🎯 Testing Instructions

### **After uploading the fixed code:**

1. **Test System Info:**

   - Visit: `http://192.168.4.1/system_info`
   - Should now show: "WiFi Status: Access Point Active"
   - Should show: "Connected Clients: 1" (when you're connected)

2. **Test File List (with Serial Monitor):**

   - Open Serial Monitor (115200 baud)
   - Try to access file manager
   - Look for debugging messages:
     ```
     📂 Listing files in: /
     🔍 SD Card status - Initialized: YES, Using SPI: NO
     ✅ Listed X files in /
     ```

3. **Test Capture (with Serial Monitor):**

   - Click "📸 Capture Image"
   - Look for messages:
     ```
     📸 Capture request received
     ✅ Frame captured: XXXX bytes
     📁 Saving to: /CAPTURE_XXXXX.jpg (SD Mode: MMC)
     ✅ Image capture successful: CAPTURE_XXXXX.jpg
     ```

4. **Test Create Folder (with Serial Monitor):**
   - Try creating a new folder
   - Look for messages:
     ```
     📁 Create folder request - Base: '/', Name: 'TestFolder'
     ✅ SD Card reconnected for folder creation
     ✅ Folder created: /TestFolder
     ```

## 🚨 Expected Error Patterns

### **If SD Card Issues Persist:**

```
❌ SD Card not available - attempting reconnection
❌ SD Card reconnection failed
❌ Failed to open directory after retries: /
```

### **If File Operations Fail:**

```
❌ Failed to create upload file after retries: /filename.jpg
❌ Upload write error: 500/1024 bytes
❌ Failed to create folder: /TestFolder
```

## 🔄 Troubleshooting Actions

### **If File List Still Empty:**

1. Check Serial Monitor for SD card errors
2. Try clicking "🔗 Reconnect SD" button
3. Power cycle ESP32 (reset button)
4. Check SD card physical connection

### **If Capture Still Fails:**

1. Verify camera is working (live stream works = camera OK)
2. Check SD card write permissions
3. Try smaller JPEG quality settings
4. Check available storage space

### **If Create Folder Fails:**

1. Verify SD card is not write-protected
2. Check folder name for invalid characters
3. Try reconnecting SD card
4. Format SD card (FAT32) if persistent issues

## 📋 Next Steps

1. **Upload the fixed code**
2. **Open Serial Monitor** (115200 baud)
3. **Test each function** while monitoring logs
4. **Report specific error messages** if issues persist

**Status:** 🔧 **DEBUGGING ENHANCED - READY FOR TESTING**
